# Private Lessons Manager

- Working on a way to change the way, we teach and engage in private lessons
- I think that we should give back to the community and teach as much as possible for free and this is my first step is building a way for out teacher to be able to give more affordable private lessons
- And on the side I'm building an app to learn everything you need for free about informatics in 3 months exactly how I build my private lessons with my students
- This will be a journey so tag along
